These are my solutions to the exercises of the first 42 school exam (Rank 02).

DISCLAIMER: I created these solutions when I practiced for the exam back in December 2024. My goal was to come up with the cleanest, simplest code I could at the time - solutions which made the most sense to me personally. **The solutions may or may not be valid as of writing. Please make sure you understand the code and do your own testing.**
